To implement resource requests and resource releases and demonstrate deadlock avoidance using the Banker's algorithm.
The program simulates resource requests/releases to/from processes and demonstrates deadlock avoidance with the Banker's algorithm. A menu controls the operations, and each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices are:
1) Enter resource claim graph data
2) Request resource by a process
3) Release resource from a process
4) Determine safe sequence of processes
5) Quit program and free memory
