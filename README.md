The program simulates resource requests/releases to/from processes, demonstrating deadlock avoidance with the Banker's algorithm.
A menu controls the operations, and each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices are:
1) Enter resource claim graph data
2) Request resources by a process
3) Release resources from a process
4) Determine a safe sequence of processes
5) Quit the program and free memory
